# JobLeader_ChromeExtension

  > Job Leader Chrome extension was developed for job seekers and job recruiters. 
  Job Leader allows its users to manually input a job's url and salary. The user may also 
  simply enter the salary of the desired job and the extension will automatically save the current tab i.e "job url".
  The user can then click the "Display Job" button and a new window will appear with the saved job information. One can 
  then use this window to save as well as print the page in order to make their job search more efficent.
